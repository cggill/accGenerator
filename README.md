# accGenerator
This program was written by me over a year ago. Since then, Runescape has been updated with a new "Jagex Accounts" system, which makes this program currently unable to perform its intended purpose. Today, I have made the bot navigate the updated site and get as far as possible into the account creation process. Progress is slowing to a halt on account of my IP being flagged from too many requests and the VPN I use being blocked by the site by default. I have also recently discovered that the use of proxies in this context may violate the site's ToS and as a result I am not going to continue work on this project. Were I to make this program work again, I would have to make the bot automatically create an email account to pass jagex's 2FA while also complying with these restrictions. The intended use of this program is to take a list of proxies from a list and generate any specified number of accounts per proxy.
